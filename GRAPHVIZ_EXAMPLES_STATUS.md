# Graphviz Examples Status Report

This document tracks the status of all Graphviz example HTML files in the `examples/` directory, documenting which diagrams render correctly and their capabilities.

**See also**: [Mermaid Examples Status](EXAMPLE_DIAGRAMS_STATUS.md) | [PlantUML Examples Status](PLANTUML_EXAMPLES_STATUS.md) | [**üé® Unified Showcase**](examples/diagram_showcase.html)

## Testing Method
- Local server running at `http://localhost:8000`
- Browser MCP used for inspection and screenshots
- Each example tested for visual rendering and console errors
- Generated using `examples/regenerate_graphviz_examples.py`

## Graphviz Features Successfully Demonstrated

### 1. Comprehensive Graph Types
- **Directed Graphs**: `digraph` with hierarchical layouts and clusters
- **Undirected Graphs**: `graph` with network topologies and connections
- **Flowcharts**: Decision trees with diamond shapes and conditional flows
- **Hierarchical**: Organizational charts with ranked layouts
- **State Machines**: Finite state automata with transitions
- **Networks**: Data flow and infrastructure diagrams
- **Dependencies**: Application architecture and component relationships
- **Clusters**: Grouped subgraphs with visual boundaries

### 2. Advanced Graphviz Features Working
- **Layout Engines**: dot (hierarchical), neato (spring model), fdp (force-directed)
- **Node Shapes**: box, circle, diamond, cylinder, ellipse, folder, hexagon
- **Styling**: fillcolor, style, penwidth, color customization
- **Subgraphs**: cluster organization with labels and backgrounds
- **Ranking**: rank constraints for layout control
- **Attributes**: comprehensive node and edge attribute support

### 3. Real-world Applications
- **System Architecture**: Microservices, data flows, component relationships
- **Network Topology**: Infrastructure, connections, device layouts
