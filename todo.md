# TODO:

- Enh: Add the ability to preview the backing diagram code within the viewer (maybe by hovering, or maybe the download button should download the diagram code as a file)
- Fix: Mermaid diagram button sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Especially the first click. Download mermaid fails, switch to PlantUML and download succeeds, switch to a different mermaid and download also succeeds
